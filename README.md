# Covid-19 New Case Prediction

The information is taken directly from https://data.go.th/ (05 July 2021). The goal of this learning is to forecast a new case of Covid-19 again for days of July 1-3. I only pick records from 01 APR 2021 to 30 JUN 2021 for analysis. The initial stage is data exploration. The features erase and empty remove processes are the next steps. After that, variable type conversion and training. Finally, make a chart and compare the prediction to a actual value.
